## USDA Cross-Country Food Demand Analysis

The data for this Shiny application was created by Anita Regmi and James L. Seale, Jr. for their study on Cross-Price Elasticities of Demand Across 114 Countries.  The source of the data can be found [here](http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/tb-technical-bulletin/tb1925.aspx).

The goal of my application was to show the disparities of the percent of expenditures for nine categories of commodities among countries with different income levels.

To use this application, select one of the radio buttons corresponding to a commodity category of interest to change the interactive components.  

Enjoy!
