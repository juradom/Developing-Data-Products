## International Food Consumption Analysis

The data for this Shiny application was obtained through the USDA and leverages the 1996 International Comparison Program (ICP) data.  The source of the data can be found in a zip file called: [International Food Consumption Patterns](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/international-food-consumption-patterns.aspx#26217).

The goal of my application was to show the consumption disparities for several food categories among 114 countries.

To use this application, select one of the radio buttons corresponding to a food category of interest to change the interactive components.  

Enjoy!
